            <h2>One In The Same</h2>
            <p>Lionel is Dark Group Leader and Dark Group Leader is Lionel. They are one in the same - two souls sharing the same vessel. The Dark Group Leader isn't necessarily a character as portrayed in the show. Rather, the Dark Group Leader is a state of mind that is brought about by the shrinking cage around our hearts. Lionel fell into an abyss of tragic events that pushed his sanity to the edge. The Dark Group Leader influencing Lionel's decisions led him to commit heinous acts on Frimians and his former best friend. But at the end of the day, it's as it was stated in the beginning: Lionel is Dark Group Leader and Dark Group Leader is Lionel. <br><br></p>

            <h2>The Caged Heart</h2>
            <p>
                This idea of the 'caged heart' is the cornerstone to analyzing what Lionel turned into. It is a metaphor he developed that portrays the concept that one's heart beats inside a cage. The size of the cage is determined by emotion. Positive emotions (happiness, laughter, affection) - the cage expands, giving the heart more space to beat calmly. Negative emotions such as fear, anger, and hatred shrink the cage, mangling the heart ache within its confines. <br><br>

                This idea is split between Patrick and Lionel. Patrick is surrounded by a lot of love. The banter he shares with his wife Loran offers him a place of comfort. Taking Livy to school, caring for her and seeing her happy brings joy to his heart. All these things give Patrick purpose - something to protect. Thus, the shrinking of the cage caused by battle and hardship can be balanced with knowing that he's doing it for the betterment of those around him.<br><br>

                However, the same cannot be said for Lionel. Lionel lost everything that makes Patrick the man he is. Lionel lost his Loran - Olivia. He lost his Livy - Luna. He lost his sanity when attacked by the lion. Lionel was left to navigate a labyrinth of loss, misery, shame, betrayal, isolation - so much more than the average human heart could handle. These emotions cause the cage to contract around your heart. And soon enough, the cage shrinks to the point that it begins to mangle the organ. This is where the bridge towards insanity begins.<br><br>

                Once the cage shrinks, the way to make it grow again is to either dump the emotional tension onto something or be around a source that has the power to make the cage grow. Patrick felt extreme emotional pressure knowing that Liana would die when she learns of what he did to Sebastian, her only son. The cage wraps tight around his heart, blackening his soul and emotional state. But Loran was there to remind him of why he was doing what he was doing. Loran finds confidence in Patrick's power and abilities, so despite the fact that she'll be in the crossfire of Patrick's escapades, she stays with him, "a hundred times over. Because I know that you'll be the reason I keep going." This is important for Patrick - a one manned army facing against those who threaten the security of the Frimians in Mynora. The affection and support he gets from Loran "make his arms move like he's breaking free from stone". This expands the cage around his heart, giving Patrick the perfect balance to keep on fighting.<br><br>

            <h2>Lionel, the Dark Group Leader</h2>
            <p> But the same doesn't go for Lionel. Returning to Frima after the war, Lionel was isolated. Though he was seen as a prominent figure at the fight academy and to the Frimians in general, he was used to dealing with his troubles alone or with Patrick. But through time, struggling alone began to get to Lionel. Training alone in the rain and pursuing a field that he grew to no longer have passion for shrinks the cage. But in this case, the cage has stayed shrunken for so long that Lionel has now adapted to its new state. His gaze grows intense and his mind darkens. But Lionel is provided some comfort in Olivia's quiet understanding that "it's not just the rain you're standing in."<br><br>

                With the birth of Luna, Lionel was once again rising to a state of tranquility, only to have it taken away from him in the same moment. Olivia dies giving birth. Lionel faced more isolation, leading him to start drinking. Lionel injured a student at the fight academy, making him lose the fight academy award he was promised if he endured the shrinking cage long enough. At that same ceremony, Lionel graduated at the field he had no passion for. He was also called up to give a speech not as a prominent fighter and tactician, but as the son of Zachary, one of the war hero who claimed Mynora for the Frimians. Coming home from such humiliation, he learned of his daughter's Luna's sudden death from her illness. In the rain, Lionel accidentally kills Carla, the winner of the fight academy award. Seeking solace, Lionel decides to return to Mynora to see Patrick. That's when he gets attacked by a lion that he fends off. At the top of a mountain, he uses the Homage Knife in front of a storm - the pinnacle of Lionel's mental torment. Each happening contracts the cage around his heart, making him go insane.<br><br>

                Lionel became numb to the cage. He's lost so much that losing another thing doesn't even register. After all the stacked misfortunes in Frima, Lionel tried to prove that he was stronger than the emotions that came with the pain at the summit. "He knows you can't show it though - not to the ones you want to protect. Not to anyone. So you pretend you're not affected. Like you've heard it all before."<br><br>

                However, doing so would only exacerbate the problem. All he was doing was pouring a little bit of hatred out from the bottle he was already used to drinking. The state of mind - the size of the cage - was normal to him. Rather than releasing the emotional tension in a healthy manner, Lionel would allow it to define him. But he only got more used to being in this state of emotional blackness. It's what made him more evil. More dark. More like someone...<br><br></p>

            <h2>The Only Way To Adapt</h2>
            <p> Lionel was at the lowest point of his life and he never once thought about taking out his anger on others or dealing with the pain in an expedient manner. But after a particular event, someone thought otherwise. Lionel smashed a mirror with a stone when he came to see Patrick in Mynora. The shards fall, leaving a fractured plane hanging in its frame - a directly depiction of Lionel's shattered psyche. There it is. Lionel's reflection - the Dark Group Leader. "The hatred stuck to you like a second skin... unbound to bring about your true desires." <br><br>

                Those desires, though revealed to be expedient in nature, shows us who Lionel has morphed into. No. This shows who Lionel is. Who he's always been. Lionel's reflection — the Dark Group Leader — is not a separate entity, but rather the manifestation of repressed rage and grief. The mirror doesn't reveal another man; it reveals the man he has become. Without the confides of society, we too "are monsters - hidden away by the mask of civilization." Lionel is no wise different than any of us. When the human race is taken back to its primal roots and survival is of the essence, the crude animalistic nature of the human race is sure to be exposed. That is what Lionel, the Dark Group Leader encompasses - two voices, one throat-screaming lies and truths alike.<br><br></p>

            <h2>The Dark Group</h2>
            <p> The Dark Group is a prime representation of the hateful dark side Lionel failed to lock away. When the cage shrinks so much that the heart looks unrecognizable, the Dark Group is what results - the embodiment of latent hatred revealed. The other four members have hate towards the Frimians because they stole the things that give them purpose and a place to call home.<br><br>

                Lionel joined the Dark Group with the sole aim of making Patrick hate him before they displace the hatred and anger they've bottled up for so long. We learn about Lionel's intentions when he faces Sebastian in the wild for the first time. "One must reciprocate the hate I possess before we fight till the death". Despite this, Lionel knows that his mind is quite irrational. The human brain craves conclusion when it comes to things they don't have all the answers to. The longer a person goes without facts or a concrete answer, the more likely they are to make up answers. The longer this goes on, the more likely they are to believe their made up answer. But Lionel knows that answer and avoids it. As a Dark Group member, Lionel dons the helm of the Dark Group Leader, the one who is dead-set on leaving Patrick no choice but to show up at the Fight Arena. He hides behind the mask of the cage as he kills many of his people with the team of elite fighters and strategists. Lionel was lying to himself. In the deepest part of his soul, he knows that he is a mixture of all his endured trauma in Frima and the actions committed by Dark Group Leader throughout the events of the show. He would perform the "It's Dark..." team attack with the Dark Group, concoct plans to make enemies attack each other and feed the Dark Group esoteric details about the Frimians to break them down slowly. <br><br></p>

            <h2>Two Sides Of The Same Coin</h2>
            <p> Displacement is the idea that a person transfers their negative feelings and emotions from one person or thing to another in order to deal with them. The tension or anxiety associated with negative feelings, such as fear, anger or hatred is released onto a non-threatening target. <br><br>

                Throughout the show, we see how Patrick's composure fractures with every loss. Lionel made his intentions clear that he strives to break Patrick's aching heart before fighting him. On Lionel's relentless stride to attack Patrick's heart, the cage shrinks further on Lionel's heart as much as it does on Patrick's.<br><br>

                Frescho constantly getting abducted never allows Patrick to catch a break. Lionel lost Carver, having to bury his alongside his grieving wife. Patrick lost Davis, clinging onto hope for him before it draws its last breath right in front of him. Lionel lost Sebastian, having to confess to a sick and frail mother that her only son was killed, watch her die also. Patrick lost Jeremy, the one who held on to the power of "one man's risk". Lionel lost Nolan - grieving heavily alongside Sheila who says goodbye to her hero at such a young age. Patrick lost Vangis - his successor that he saw as a son. Lionel lost Miguel - a mentor and friend who helped him adapt further to the shrinking cage as tragic events passed.<br><br>

                Patrick and Lionel are prime examples of the effects of treated and untreated anger. It may not be so obvious, but Patrick is the same monster as Lionel. He has been through the exact same pain (in principle) that brought out the Dark Group Leader in Lionel. Patrick and Lionel have lived very similar lives, but the only difference is how they dealt with the challenges that came with that kind of life. Patrick got help with those emotions, even at times being forced to accept it "Sit there, shut up, and let me help you!". This turned him into the respectable and honourable character we see throughout the show. It's people like Loran, Mitchell, Jessica, and Livy that prevented Patrick from turning into the Dark Group Leader himself. <br><br>

                However, Lionel lost everything that made Patrick the way he is. Thus, he came to deal with his untreated anger the way the cage has influenced him to, bringing out the worst side of him. Lionel knows that it lives in Patrick too. "I know what kind of man he is. I know how he fights, how he thinks. He too is embroiled by the shrinking cage, just like me. He'll come to the arena scarred by purpose. Whereas I am summoned by the scars of loss."<br><br>

                Patrick reveals his Dark Group Leader side in the Fight Arena. Unable to feign weakness against the anger and hatred he has grown towards Lionel, we see now what this is has all been about to Lionel. As much of a monster he is, Lionel wants to prove to himself that that same monster lives in someone as stoic, loving and powerful as Patrick, justifying his actions to some degree. "Because you need it to happen. It's how you become strong. How I came into the picture."<br><br>

                Patrick and Lionel are brothers in arms - one and the same - two sides of the same coin. This is literal in how they act during emotional breakdown. Patrick and Lionel both have Homage Knives.<br><br>

                The Homage Knife is a token of legacy, able to be converted into a sword with the use of armor material and blood of the user. The use of the Homage Knife signifies an emotional breaking point already reached in the moment.<br><br>

                For Patrick, the final straw was when he witnessed Vangis's death right before his eyes. Vangis died not only because of his obligation towards duty, but because Patrick wasn't able to lock away the emotions that dragged Vangis into the indirect conflict between him and Lionel. "All I wanted... was to save him from himself. To save him from the darkness he's kept buried... all this time." This led to him punching the tree stump nonstop - a cry to bleed out the Dark Group Leader from one's soul.<br><br>

                Lionel had reached his breaking point a long time ago. He already faced just as much trauma as Patrick before using the Homage Knife. The lion attack was the key the opened the Dark Group Leader's cell. Lionel too punched the tree stump and used the Homage Knife. <br><br></p>

            <h2>Ending Note/ Conclusion</h2>
            <p> Patrick's death confirms what Dark Group Leader has been telling Lionel in their deep identity crisis fight. Lionel believes himself to be capricious: one who has a tendency to suddenly, and/ or unaccountably change their attitude or behavior, often making them unpredictable and impulsive. But Dark Group Leader says this is false.<br><br>

                Dark Group Leader stands on the fact that everything Lionel did throughout the show was his doing. If anything, Dark Group Leader is nothing more than Lionel's inner demon that the shrinking cage makes him listen and abide to. Lionel tries to deflect, saying that Dark Group Leader was in control. He believed that Dark Group Leader would do things and leave Lionel to deal with the aftermath. But then again, Lionel is Dark Group Leader and Dark Group Leader is Lionel. Everything Dark Group Leader does, Lionel does. Because this is who he is and Dark Group Leader demands that he accepts it.<br><br>

                Lionel can be said to be "the Nolan that wasn't killed that day". Broken, Expedient and Obsessed. For everyone's sake, both had to be put down, but only one of them were. "Keysh saw it - how crazy I'd become. She did everyone a favour in killing me."<br><br>

                In the end, the Dark Group Leader was never Lionel's enemy — he was his mirror. The moment Lionel accepts that truth, the line between man and monster dissolves. What remains is not two beings, but one fractured soul, forever at odds with itself. Now, Lionel is now placed in the grayest zone yet - trusted by no one, not even himself. "You left a conqueror. And returned a traitor." <br><br></p>
