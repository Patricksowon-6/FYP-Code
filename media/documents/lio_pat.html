        “What I lived with. What I’ve put up with. What I’ve had to endure”

        Barely Off The Hook
            Have this moment show that even Patrick needs help but can be stubborn as to not accept it, let alone look for it. But Loran helping him smacked 
            him in the face, reminding him that he can't do everything alone. Link this with Lionel never accepting or looking for help at all when he 
            desperately needed it which resulted in him becoming the man he is currently. The similar mind of Patrick & Lionel. Patrick got help when he needed it,
            but the same cannot be said about Lionel.

        Patrick: Refer to Vangis dying
            Lionel has been going through this his entire life.

        Talk about Patrick, the people around him and the Frimians. How he made Patrick hate Lionel and forced him to go to the Fight Arena

        "Maturing is realizing just how good of a friend Goku was. He knew Vegeta needed this fight more than anything. He not only put the world at 
        risk so Vegeta could get his get back, but he actively held back to make Vegeta believe they were on the same level". Lionel and Patrick need this 
        fight.

            
        "Treated (Patrick) VS Untreated (Lionel)"
        Patrick is "breaking a broken heart"

        Lionel chose to fight Patrick because he's the only one who understands what he's going through. Given how similar their lives have been, Lionel does
        the only thing he can think to do now to release the hate in him: to fight Patrick.


        Patrick & Lionel in Lock Up. 
            Lionel's conversation with Patrick. 
            How he felt walking past the dead 'doomed' victim
            Lionel's confliction when he saw Nolan flying outside the cell window. Choosing to leave and go back to the Dark Group

            (Lionel is conflicted when he sees Nolan flying outside the cell window. Lionel came to Lock Up 
            to really try and get good with Patrick. He wanted to know what it felt like to be his friend and put
            an end to what he's been doing. But he did't feel good about it and decided to continue on the path 
            he already chose. He chooses to escape Lock Up and choose the Dark Group over Patrick.

            Lionel is being brought his food. But as he goes to take it, he pulls the guard towards him, smashing his face into 
            the iron bars of the cell. This knocks him out. He drags him towards the cell and searches for the keys. He grabs it, unlocks the door and 
            is ready to leave.

            The man makes it to the gate where prisoners were let out for work. The open field is easy to traverse and here, we see how fast the man is
            on his feet. Whe he makes it to a set of trees, we see Miguel and Nolan. It was the Lionel that was in the cell with Patrick. The Dark Group move 
            out again.)

            Patrick and Lionel lived very similar lives. The only difference is how they dealt with it. Patrick got help and was able to let out his emotions in healthier ways than 
            Lionel did. Lionel, for too long, was left with his intrusive thoughts, which is when DGL can into the picture. At times when he needed help, the most, he refused to get 
            it and carried all of his pain privately.

        Their discussion at the Ritual Temple.
            Patrick abandoning Lionel to fight the Assailants alone.

            Lionel is envious of Patrick & Loran's Relationship

        Patrick: Refer to Vangis dying
            Lionel has been going through this his entire life.

        Lionel chose to fight Patrick because he's the only one who understands what he's going through. Given how similar their lives have been, Lionel
        sees Patrick as the only one who can truly understand him, hence the only one who can help him release the hate in his heart/ grow the cage on his heart.

        Lionel needs this fight and Patrick gave it to him. Not only to save and fight for the people he cares about, but also for his friend that he 
        abandoned.
            "Maturing is realizing just how good of a friend Goku was. He knew Vegeta needed this fight more than anything. He not only put the world 
            at risk so Vegeta could get his get back, but he actively held back to make Vegeta believe they were on the same level".

        "Treated (Patrick) VS Untreated (Lionel)"
            Patrick was "breaking Lionel's broken heart"



        Loran comes up to Patrick and asks how he's holding up. But before she can ask it, Patrick interrupts her, saying not to ask him the question. When Patrick is 
        asked "How are you?", he's being asked about his current emotional state. Patrick will think about how he's actually feeling, which is likely 
        going to be negative, given what he's been going through. For Patrick to stay stoic and strong, he doesn't like to think about how he's doing. Because he'll 
        have to think about how he's really doing, which involves getting emotional.
